# REVIEW OF J'QUERY

- DOM manipulation
  - Document Object Model
- Javascript library, which introduces a bunch of cool functionality
  - selectors
  - appending things
  - toggling visibility of things
  - adding listeners

- Framework
  - doesn't matter
  - overlap between a library and framework

- I want:
  - Selectors
  - Adding listeners
  - HTTP REQUESTS AJAX

TinyApp
- Routes that we make requests to
  - GET /u/lajshdajshd
  - POST /urls {}
  - HTTP: REQ -> RES (code, and the thing that we asked for)
  -
